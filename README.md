### Vehicle Fuel Consumption

Introduction: 
The "Vehicle Fuel Consumption Prediction" project aims to explore vehicle characteristics, analyze fuel efficiency, and assess environmental impacts. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, this project identifies critical factors influencing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. It applies machine learning models to predict metrics such as miles per gallon (MPG) and carbon dioxide emissions, providing actionable insights for stakeholders including consumers, automotive industry professionals, and policymakers.
This initiative is motivated by the need for sustainable transportation solutions and informed decision-making regarding fuel-efficient technologies.
